## How to play

1. **Roll the dice:** On your turn, click the big **ROLL** button to roll all 5 dice.
2. **Hold the dice:** After your 1st and 2nd roll, you can choose to keep any dice you want. Simply click on a die to **hold it** (a padlock icon will appear). When you click ROLL again, only the un-held dice will be re-rolled. You can also click a held die again to unlock it!
3. **Score your turn:** At any point during your turn (even after the 1st roll), you can lock in a score by clicking one of the available categories on the **Score Sheet**. 
4. **Choose carefully:** Once a category is scored, it cannot be used again for the rest of the game! If your dice do not match any available categories, you will be forced to score **0 points** in a category of your choice.
5. **Next player:** Once a score is locked in, your turn instantly ends and it passes to the next player!
